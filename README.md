Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I Don't Know! 

Language patcher by ArtLavrov

Used utilities:

* Paktools (https://github.com/artlavrov/paktools)
* JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler (https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler)
* wfLZEx (.anb to .png converter) may be useful too (https://github.com/meh2481/wfLZEx)

You will need resources from the original game.

Files that should be updated (fonts can be replaced with with JPEXS FFD, texts with ltbtools.py):

* global.pak: *.ttf, *.swf, localization.ltb
* menus.pak: *.swf
* shop.pak: *.swf
* tutorial.pak: *.swf

Also, yet there are some pictures in menus.pak/mainmenu.swf that would be nice to translate.
Also the loading icon isn't replaced yet (loadingicons.pak/loading.anb).
